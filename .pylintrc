# Regular expression which should only match function or class names that do not
# require a docstring.
no-docstring-rgx=^_

[IMPORTS]
# Allow wildcard imports for gi.repository, which is a common pattern.
# This specific option might not exist or work as expected for pylint directly,
# often this is handled by telling pylint about the C extensions.
# For now, this is a placeholder; actual GI GObject introspection issues
# are often handled by `pylint-gi` or by generating stubs.
# If `import-error` or `no-name-in-module` become an issue for Gtk/Adw,
# those would be disabled here or in a `pyproject.toml` for pylint.

[TYPECHECK]
# List of members which are set dynamically and ignored by pylint checking for
# attributes defined in __init__. Usually for Gtk.Template.Child or similar.
# Example: generated-members=Gtk.*,Gio.*,GLib.*,GObject.*,Adw.*
# This is often better handled by pylint plugins like pylint-gi.
# For a basic .pylintrc, we might not need this if not running pylint in a way that checks this heavily.

# Tell pylint known C extensions. This helps with `import-error` for Gtk/Adw.
extension-pkg-whitelist=gi

# Ignore specific modules for import errors if they are known to be problematic
# ignored-modules=gi.repository
